## 📊 API Documentation

The system includes RESTful APIs for mobile app integration:
- Student API endpoints
- Parent API endpoints
- Authentication APIs
- **Nepali (BS) calendar dates** — every date field has a companion `_bs` field (e.g. `date_bs`, `start_date_bs`). The `app_settings` response includes `calendar_type: "nepali"` so the mobile app knows which calendar to display.

See [`Integrate_BS_nepali_calendar.md`](Integrate_BS_nepali_calendar.md) for the full Flutter integration guide.
